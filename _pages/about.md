This is the official website of ADLab (ADG at Shanghai AI Laboratory).

As a research team affiliated with the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, ADLab is primarily focused on cutting-edge research in autonomous driving. Our current endeavor involves developing the next-generation autonomous driving system by integrating human knowledge and common sense. We believe that the knowledge-driven paradigm will elevate the reliability and generalizability of autonomous driving system to a new level.

Now we have about 20 faculty members and 20+ interns (including full-time research interns and joint Ph.D. students). Join us and writing the pages of history.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
